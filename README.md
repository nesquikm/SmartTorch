SmartTorch
==========

Really smart torch widget for Android.

SmartTorch can turns off automatically by a timer, and remain on until you put the gadget on the table (ie, as long as you keep the gadget in your hands: uses accelerometer). You will not need to turn off the flashlight: you just put the phone and it switches itself off!

Widget is able to work on home screen and lock screen (widget on a lock screen feature is supported in Android 4.2+).

SmartTorch supports modes that you can switch by flipping through them in the widget. 
The mode defines:
* timeout after which the flashlight is turned off (âˆž means that will work until you turn it off) 
* determines whether a accelerometer (shake sensor) enabled, which allows to keep the flashlight on until you don't put the gadget on the table

The list of modes can be changed in the configuration window that appears when you put the widget on the home screen or lock screen. The configuration window can also be called by double-clicking on an existing widget (on your home screen, not on a lock screen).

In addition to the list of modes it is possible to set the threshold of sensitivity of the accelerometer (acceleration at which SmartTorch will assume that the gadget is stationary). You can choose one of three pre-defined levels of sensitivity, or calibrate the threshold for your gadget (at the time of calibration your gadget should remain motionless, since the application measures the noise level of the accelerometer  and automatically sets the threshold). Calibration allows to maximize the sensitivity to motions limited by accelerometer's noises.

SmartTorch doesn't eats battery when turned off, contains no advertising and other not related with a flashlight garbage.
